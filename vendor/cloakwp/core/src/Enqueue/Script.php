   *    "async": Script is executed as soon as they are loaded by the browser. Asynchronous scripts do not have a guaranteed execution order, as script B (although added to the DOM after script A) may execute first given that it may complete loading prior to script A. Such scripts may execute either before the DOM has been fully constructed or after the DOMContentLoaded event.
